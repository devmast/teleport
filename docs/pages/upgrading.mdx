The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

## Upgrading compatibility overview

Since Teleport is a distributed system with a number of services that run on
potentially many hosts, you should take care when upgrading the cluster to
ensure that all components remain compatible.

The [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./upgrading/overview.mdx) guide provides
an overview of how to upgrade the components in your Teleport cluster while
preserving compatibility.

## Upgrading self-hosted clusters

After reading the Upgrading Overview, self-hosted Teleport administrators should
follow one of the guides below to upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service:

- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/auth-proxy-helm.mdx)
- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/auth-proxy-linux.mdx)

## Upgrading agents

We recommend that Teleport users set up automatic agent upgrades, where agents
query a **version server** in order to determine whether they are out of date
and need to install a new version of Teleport. Read one of the following guides
to set up automatic agent upgrades:

- [Self-hosted Teleport clusters](./upgrading//self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates.mdx)
- [Teleport Cloud](./upgrading//enroll-agent-into-automatic-updates.mdx)

For special circumstances, you can also read about how to upgrade agents
manually in your environment (the instructions are the same for self-hosted and
Teleport Cloud clusters):

- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/agents-helm.mdx)
- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/agents-linux.mdx)
