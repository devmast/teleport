The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

## Upgrading compatibility overview

Since Teleport is a distributed system with a number of services that run on
potentially many hosts, you should take care when upgrading the cluster to
ensure that all components remain compatible.

The [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./upgrading/overview.mdx) guide provides
an overview of how to upgrade the components in your Teleport cluster while
preserving compatibility.

## Upgrading self-hosted clusters

After reading the Upgrading Overview, self-hosted Teleport administrators should
follow one of the guides below to upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service:

- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/auth-proxy-helm.mdx)
- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/auth-proxy-linux.mdx)

## Upgrading agents

We recommend that Teleport users set up automatic agent upgrades, where agents
query a **version server** in order to determine whether they are out of date
and need to install a new version of Teleport. 

On Teleport Cloud, the version server is managed for you.

If you are running Teleport Enterprise, read the [Self-Hosted Automatic Agent
Updates](./upgrading/self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates.mdx) guide to set up
the version server yourself.

Read [Enroll Agents into Automatic
Updates](./upgrading//enroll-agent-into-automatic-updates.mdx) for how to set up
Teleport agents to query the version server and install new versions of Teleport
when they fall out of date.

For special circumstances, you can also read about how to upgrade agents
manually in your environment (the instructions are the same for self-hosted and
Teleport Cloud clusters):

- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/agents-helm.mdx)
- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/agents-linux.mdx)
