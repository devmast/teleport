title: Upgrading Teleport
description: Explains how to upgrade Teleport depending on your environment and edition.

The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

## Upgrading concepts

A Teleport cluster consists of the Teleport Auth Service, Teleport Proxy
Service, and Teleport agents. (Read the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.mdx) guide
for an explanation of key architectural terms.)

Because a Teleport cluster is a distributed system, you must adhere to the
following principles when upgrading different components in the system.

### Component compatibility

Teleport uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers
include a major version, minor version, and patch version, separated by dots.

(!docs/pages/includes/compatibility.mdx!)

In Teleport Team and Teleport Enterprise Cloud, we manage the Auth and Proxy
Services for you. You can determine the current version of these services by
running the following command, where `mytenant` is the name of your Teleport
Team or Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant:

```code
$ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.server_version'
```

### Upgrade sequence

You must adhere to the following sequence when upgrading a Teleport cluster:

Teleport requires upgrading the Teleport Cluster from one major version to
another in sequence.  If you are currently on version 11.x, you must upgrade to
the latest version 12.x before going to version 13.x. To upgrade in sequence,
upgrade the Teleport cluster and confirm a healthy start before continuing to
the next version.

When upgrading a single Teleport cluster:

- Upgrade the **Auth Service** to the next **major version first**.  The Auth
  Service keeps the cluster state. If there are data format changes introduced
  in the new version, the Auth Service performs the necessary migrations.  After
  the upgrade, start the Auth Service and CONFIRM that it's in a healthy state
  before continuing.
- Upgrade Proxy Service instances to the same version number as the Auth
  Service.  Proxy Service instances are stateless and can be upgraded in any
  sequence or at the same time.
- Upgrade your Teleport resource services to the same version number as the Auth
  Service.  You can upgrade resource agents in any sequence or at the same time.
   
   If you are upgrading more then one version number, repeat these steps until
   you reach your target major version number.

If several Auth Service instances are running in the High Availability
configuration (for example, in an AWS Auto Scaling group), you must shrink the
group to **just one Auth Service** before performing an upgrade.

While Teleport will attempt to perform any necessary migrations, we recommend
users create a backup of their backend before upgrading the Auth Server as a
precaution. This allows for a safe rollback in case the migration itself fails.

When upgrading multiple clusters:

- Upgrade the root cluster—that is, the cluster that other clusters trust—first.
- Verify the upgrade was successful.
- Upgrade the trusted leaf clusters.

The Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service are upgraded automatically. When
upgrading resource services, you may upgrade in any sequence or at the same
time.

When upgrading multiple clusters:

- Upgrade the root cluster—that is, the cluster that other clusters trust—first.
- Verify the upgrade was successful.
- Upgrade the trusted leaf clusters.
