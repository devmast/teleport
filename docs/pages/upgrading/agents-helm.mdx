title: Upgrading Teleport Agents on Kubernetes
description: Explains how to upgrade Teleport agents running on Kubernetes.
---

This guide explains a manual approach to upgrading Teleport agents running on
Kubernetes.

For instructions on setting up Teleport agents to upgrade themselves
automatically, read the following guides: {/*TODO: link to  the agent guides*/}

An agent is a `teleport` binary that runs services other than the Auth Service
and Proxy Service, and proxies resources in your infrastructure. Examples
include the Teleport SSH Service and Teleport Database Service.

For an overview of how Teleport agents function within a Teleport cluster, read
the [Teleport Agents](../agents/introduction.mdx) documentation.

## Prerequisites

{/*TODO: Talk about the upgrade sequence here. The Auth/Proxy should be
upgraded first, I think. Link to the guides on upgrading these*/}

- A running Teleport cluster with at least one agent deployed using the
  `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart. 

This guide assumes that you have configured the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart
with a values file called `values.yaml`, and that your release is called
`teleport-agent`.

## Upgrade your `teleport-kube-agent` Helm release

Run the following commands to upgrade Teleport agents running on Kubernetes.

1. Update the Teleport Helm chart repository so you can install the latest
   version of the `teleport-kube-agent` chart:

  (!docs/pages//kubernetes-access/helm/includes/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

1. Upgrade the Helm release:

  ```code
  $ helm upgrade teleport-agent teleport-kube-agent --version=(=teleport.version=) --values=values.yaml
  ```
