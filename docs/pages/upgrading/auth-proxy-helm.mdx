title: Upgrading the Auth Service and Proxy Service on Kubernetes
description: Explains how to upgrade the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service when self-hosting Teleport on Kubernetes
---

This guide explains how to upgrade Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service
instances running on Kubernetes.

{/*TODO: More context, e.g., what to do re: agents*/}

## Prerequisites

- A Teleport cluster deployed with the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart.
{/*TODO: Add a chart link*/}

## Upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service

{/*TODO: intro paragraph*/}

{/*TODO: Are there any other steps, e.g., having one instance of the Auth
Service? Look at the existing guides*/}

Run the following commands to upgrade Auth Service and Proxy Service instances
running on Kubernetes.

1. Update the Teleport Helm chart repository so you can install the latest
   version of the `teleport-cluster` chart:

  (!docs/pages//kubernetes-access/helm/includes/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

1. Upgrade the Helm release. This command assumes you are configuring your
   cluster with a values file called `values.yaml`:

  ```code
  helm upgrade --version=(=teleport.version=) --values=values.yaml
  ```

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart automatically waits for the previous version
of the Proxy Service to stop responding to requests before running a new version
of the Auth Service.
