// VariableDuration is a duration generator that varies its output based on a
// counter. This type is used to implement intervals that should become less frequent
// as load increases, namely heartbeats. Typically, heartbeats should happen very frequently
// to ensure that changes become visible quickly. This becomes problematic at large scales,
// where the resource consumption of heartbeats becomes onerous. This type attempts to provide
// a reasonable compromise between frequency and scalabiltiy by slowly scaling up the duration
// as the associated counter is increased. Scaling is determined by the square root of the quotient
// of Counter / Step. Min and max duration should be selected based on the needs of the resource
// in question. How quickly/slowly the duration scales is then controlled by picking a step size,
// with larger step sizes resulting in slower scaling.
